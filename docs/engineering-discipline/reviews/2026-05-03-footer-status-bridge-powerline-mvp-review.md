# Footer Status Bridge + Powerline MVP Review

**Date:** 2026-05-03 20:29
**Plan Document:** `docs/engineering-discipline/plans/2026-05-03-footer-status-bridge-powerline-mvp.md`
**Verdict:** PASS

---

## Scope Baseline Decision

An earlier review attempt failed because the repository already contains dirty/untracked files outside this milestone's planned file set. The user explicitly approved treating those existing dirty files as separate work and rerunning review against the M1 planned files and explicit out-of-scope checks.

This review therefore verifies:
- Planned M1 implementation files: `extensions/agentic-harness/footer.ts`, `extensions/agentic-harness/tests/footer.test.ts`, `extensions/agentic-harness/tests/extension.test.ts`.
- Explicit out-of-scope guard: no changes to `extensions/agentic-harness/package.json`, `extensions/agentic-harness/package-lock.json`, or `extensions/fff-search/index.ts`.
- Full test/build regression suite.

## 1. File Inspection Against Plan

| Planned File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `extensions/agentic-harness/footer.ts` | OK | Imports `truncateToWidth`/`visibleWidth`, keeps `RoachFooter` constructor/lifecycle, renders segmented width-safe footer lines, reads `footerData.getExtensionStatuses()`, and preserves plan/milestone panels above the normal footer. |
| `extensions/agentic-harness/tests/footer.test.ts` | OK | Focused footer tests cover no statuses, one status, stable multiple-status ordering, empty/whitespace status filtering, long-status truncation, and narrow width fitting. |
| `extensions/agentic-harness/tests/extension.test.ts` | OK | `@earendil-works/pi-tui` mock includes `visibleWidth` and width-aware `truncateToWidth` for the new `footer.ts` imports. |

### Acceptance Criteria Check

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `footerData.getExtensionStatuses()` renders visible statuses for none, one, multiple, long, and cleared/empty states. | OK | Covered by `tests/footer.test.ts`; implementation reads `getExtensionStatuses()` during render and filters blank values. |
| Footer visible width never exceeds `render(width)` across narrow and wide cases. | OK | Covered by `tests/footer.test.ts`; implementation routes normal footer lines through width-safe segment rendering. |
| Existing cwd, git, model, context, cache, tools, plan, and milestone information remains visible according to priority. | OK | Footer tests cover cwd/git/model/context/cache/tools; plan/milestone focused tests pass. |
| `RoachFooter` lifecycle, subscriptions, timers, and `dispose()` behavior remain covered. | OK | Existing `tests/plan-progress.test.ts` and `tests/milestone-tracker.test.ts` pass. |

## 2. Test Results

| Test Command | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `npm --prefix extensions/agentic-harness test -- --run tests/footer.test.ts` | PASS | 6/6 footer tests passed. |
| `npm --prefix extensions/agentic-harness test -- --run tests/footer.test.ts tests/plan-progress.test.ts tests/milestone-tracker.test.ts tests/extension.test.ts` | PASS | 125/125 focused tests passed. |
| `npm --prefix extensions/agentic-harness test && npm --prefix extensions/agentic-harness run build` | PASS | Vitest: 44 files passed, 541 tests passed. Build: `tsc --noEmit` passed. |
| `git diff -- extensions/agentic-harness/package.json extensions/agentic-harness/package-lock.json extensions/fff-search/index.ts` | PASS | No diff output. |

**Full Test Suite:** PASS — 541 tests passed, 0 failed; build passed.

## 3. Code Quality

- [x] No placeholders in planned implementation files
- [x] No debug code in planned implementation files
- [x] No commented-out code blocks in planned implementation files
- [x] No M1 changes to explicit out-of-scope package/lock/fff-search files

**Findings:** None for the scoped M1 review.

## 4. Git History

| Planned Commit | Actual Commit | Match |
|---|---|---|
| Not specified in plan | M1 work is uncommitted in the working tree. | N/A |

## 5. Overall Assessment

M1 satisfies the plan. The footer now renders a Powerline-style segmented base footer, surfaces extension statuses, enforces width safety for normal footer lines, and preserves plan/milestone progress behavior. Focused tests, the full test suite, TypeScript build, and explicit dependency/scope checks all pass.

## 6. Follow-up Actions

- Proceed to M1 checkpoint and integration check.
- Continue with M2 only after the M1 checkpoint is written.
