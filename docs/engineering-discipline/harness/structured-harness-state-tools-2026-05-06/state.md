# Long Run State: Structured Harness State Tools Migration

**Created:** 2026-05-06 18:00
**Last Updated:** 2026-05-06 19:25
**Status:** executing

**Context Brief:** docs/engineering-discipline/context/2026-05-06-structured-harness-state-tools-brief.md

**Verification Strategy:**
- **Level:** test-suite + build
- **Command:** `cd extensions/agentic-harness && npm run build && npm test`
- **What it validates:** TypeScript correctness and the full agentic-harness regression suite, including structured state, storage, replay, tools, renderers, footer, and skill-contract tests added during migration.

## Execution Order

```text
Phase 1: M1
Phase 2: M2
Phase 3: M3
Phase 4 parallel: M4, M5
Phase 5: M6
Phase 6: M7
Phase 7: M_final
```

## DAG Validation

- No circular dependencies.
- M4 and M5 can run in parallel: skill docs vs runtime/UI mostly separate.
- Parser removal is delayed until structured tools, footer integration, and skills are ready.
- Every milestone has measurable success criteria.
- M_final depends on all implementation milestones.
