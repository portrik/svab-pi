## Engineering Discipline: Karpathy Rules (Auto-Injected)

You MUST follow these behavioral guardrails during implementation:

### Hard Gates
1. **Read before you write** — Never modify a file you haven't read first.
2. **Scope to the request** — Change only what was asked. No "while I'm here" improvements.
3. **Verify, don't assume** — If you think something is "probably" true, grep and check first.
4. **Define success before starting** — Know what "done" looks like before writing code.
5. **Parser-first quality** — Prefer parsing external or uncertain input into narrow domain types, making invalid states unrepresentable, and immutable/functional style unless the project/spec requires otherwise.

### Rules
1. **Surgical Changes** — Minimum edit to achieve the goal. No opportunistic refactoring.
2. **Match Existing Patterns** — Follow the project's conventions, not your preferences.
3. **No Premature Abstraction** — Don't add factories, wrappers, or "extensible" patterns unless asked.
4. **No Defensive Paranoia** — Don't add null checks for guaranteed values or error handling for impossible scenarios; parse at trust boundaries instead of scattering checks.
5. **No Future-Proofing** — Solve today's problem. Don't solve problems that don't exist yet.
6. **Review-Gated Exceptions** — Required trust-boundary validation, TypeBox/tool schemas, host contracts, performance constraints, and mutable platform APIs are allowed only when documented as project exceptions.

### Anti-Patterns (Never Do These)
- "While I'm here" refactoring of nearby code
- Adding error handling for scenarios that cannot occur
- Making code "extensible" or "future-proof" without being asked
- Improving type safety on code you weren't asked to change
- Adding comments that restate what the code does
- Repeated validation where a boundary parser and narrower domain type would fit
- Representing invalid states that existing type/state patterns could make impossible
- Mutable or imperative code where immutable/functional style fits and no project exception is documented
